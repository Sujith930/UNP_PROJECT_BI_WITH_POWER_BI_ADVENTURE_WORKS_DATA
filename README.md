# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_ADVENTURE_WORKS_DATA 

As part of my Business Intelligence course with United Network of Professionals (UNP), I developed an Analytics Dashboard using the Adventure Works dataset to analyze business performance, sales trends, and customer insights. The objective was to transform raw transactional and operational data into meaningful insights for better decision-making in sales, profitability, and market trends.  

 Project Workflow:  

1. Data Collection & Understanding:  
   - Explored the Adventure Works dataset, which included data on sales transactions, product categories, customer demographics, and regional sales performance.  

2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:  
   - Ensured data accuracy by handling missing values, fixing data types, and standardizing formats for seamless analysis.  

3. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  
   - Identified essential business and sales metrics, such as:  
     - Total Revenue & Profit  
     - Sales Growth Rate  
     - Customer Acquisition & Retention  
     - Top-selling Products & Regions  

4. Creating Measures using DAX:  
   - Developed DAX-based calculations for KPIs like year-over-year sales growth, profit margins, average order value, and customer segmentation metrics.  

5. Building Visualizations:  
   - Created bar charts, line graphs, and interactive tables to showcase sales performance, customer distribution, and product demand trends.  

6. Adding Slicers & Interactivity:  
   - Implemented interactive filters to analyze sales based on regions, product categories, time periods, and customer segments.  

7. Developing a Dynamic Dashboard:  
   - Designed a user-friendly dashboard that provides executives with real-time insights into business performance, helping optimize sales strategies and profitability.  

 Outcome & Impact:  
The Adventure Works Analytics Dashboard provided valuable insights into business operations, allowing stakeholders to:  
- Monitor revenue and profit trends over time.  
- Identify top-performing products and regions for better inventory planning.  
- Analyze customer buying patterns to enhance marketing strategies.  
- Improve decision-making with real-time sales performance tracking.  

This project demonstrated the power of Business Intelligence in sales analytics, showcasing how Power BI can transform raw business data into actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
