# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_ADVENTURE_WORKS_DATA

As part of my Business Intelligence course with United Network of Professionals (UNP), I developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using the Adventure Works dataset to analyze workforce trends and employee performance. The objective was to transform raw HR data into meaningful insights for better decision-making on employee retention, salary trends, and workforce planning.  
 
Project Workflow:  
 
1. Data Collection & Understanding:  

   - Explored the Adventure Works HR dataset, which included employee details such as job roles, departments, salary, hire date, and attrition status.  
 
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:  

   - Addressed missing values, standardized data types, and ensured data consistency for accurate reporting.  
 
3. Defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):  

   - Identified crucial HR metrics such as attrition rate, employee tenure, department-wise salary distribution, and promotion trends.  
 
4. Creating Measures using DAX:  

   - Developed DAX-based calculations for KPIs like average tenure, attrition percentage, total workforce count, and salary distribution across roles.  
 
5. Building Visualizations:  

   - Created bar charts, line graphs, and tables to represent workforce demographics, salary distribution, and performance metrics.  
 
6. Adding Slicers & Interactivity:  

   - Implemented interactive filters to analyze data based on job role, department, and experience level.  
 
7. Developing a Dynamic Dashboard:  

   - Designed a comprehensive dashboard that allows HR teams to gain insights into workforce trends, helping with talent retention and HR decision-making.  
 
Outcome & Impact:  

The dashboard enabled Adventure Works HR teams to:  

- Track employee attrition trends and identify key influencing factors.  

- Analyze salary patterns and workforce distribution by department.  

- Improve hiring and retention strategies through data-driven insights.  

- Enhance workforce planning for better employee engagement and productivity.  

This project showcased how Power BI can be leveraged for HR analytics, turning raw data into actionable insights for strategic workforce management.
